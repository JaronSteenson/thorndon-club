                <h2>Club Nights</h2>
                <p>Squash club nights are every week on Thursdays 5:30 to 8pm and Sundays 3 to 5pm.</p>
                <h3>Who can come along?</h3>
                <p>
                    Anyone who is a member or considering becoming one. Guests are welcome to come down and
                    try out the facilities if they are thinking of joining the club. There is no fee for using
                    the courts, balls, or rackets for them. We do ask that after their 2nd visit and they wish
                    to continue coming along that they join as a club member.
                </p>
                <h3>What do I do?</h3>
                <p>
                    Come down to the club from about 5:30pm on Thursdays or 3pm on Sundays, wander into the
                    squash area (follow the outside landing) and let a member know that you are new and here
                    for club night. They’ll show you the ropes and introduce you to fellow members.
                </p>
                <h3>What do I need?</h3>
                <p>
                    Some gear to do some running around in (squash is energetic) and some non-marking sports
                    shoes. If you’ve got a squash racquet, that is good. If not, the club can lend you one for
                    the night (you’ll need to buy one if you want to join and keep playing though). The club
                    supplies squash balls for club nights.
                </p>
                <h3>What Else Happens?</h3>
                <p>
                    On Thursday between 6 and 7pm, we rotate people and courts every 10 minutes, a great way
                    to get to play different people at different levels. It’s quite popular, so there’ll be 3
                    or more people on each court, playing games such as 10AB, King/Queen of the court,
                    three-quarter court, rabbit, and doubles.

                <h2>Interclub</h2>
                <p>
                    Autumn Interclub starts in March, Winter Interclub in May/June, and Spring Interclub in
                    August/September. If you want to play please contact the club captain to register your
                    interest with the Squash Club Captain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you’re serious about squash or even wanting a little more challenge than the social
                    games you’ve been playing, then Interclub is the competition for you. Interclub is all
                    about being a team player and is a great way to improve your game!
                </p>
                <h3>What happens?</h3>
                <p>
                    Where possible, you will be placed in a team from 4–6 players of similar graded ability
                    with a team captain. You play once a week on Tuesdays or Wednesdays, 7 pm-11 pm. Games are
                    alternated throughout the Wellington region with five home games and five away games. The
                    home team supplies supper after the games.
                </p>
                <h3>Who can play?</h3>
                <p>This competition is only open to full club members.</p>

                <p>
                    If you’re serious about tennis or even wanting a little more challenge than the social
                    games you’ve been playing – then Interclub is the competition for you. Interclub is all
                    about being a team player and is a great way to improve your game!
                </p>
                <h3>What happens?</h3>
                <p>
                    Where possible, you will be placed in a team from four to eight players of similarly
                    graded ability and with a team captain. You play once a week on Saturday, 8:30-12 noon for
                    Tecnifibre teams and 1-5pm for premier teams. Games are throughout the Wellington region.

                <h2>Club Days</h2>
                <p>
                    All members and new visitors are welcome! The Thorndon Club day runs three days every
                    week:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Saturday afternoons from 2 pm until 6 pm</li>
                    <li>Sunday afternoons from 2 pm until 6 pm</li>
                    <li>Wednesday evenings from 5.30 pm until about 7.30 pm</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>What happens on club day?</h3>
                <p>
                    Club days are friendly tennis matches coordinated by a volunteer club member on each club
                    day. All people that turn up to play will be matched with three other players to play
                    doubles matches. An afternoon tea is served on Saturdays and the bar is open on Wednesdays
                    from 5.30 pm and Saturdays from 4.30 pm.
                </p>
                <h3>How many courts do we have?</h3>
                <p>
                    We use one hard court, two astro courts, and two grass courts. There is usually a little
                    wait between games whilst other games finish. Some Saturdays there is an interclub game
                    which reduces the number of courts available for club day, but we give people good warning
                    of this. This means that we can have up to 30 people during a club day and everyone gets
                    several games.
                </p>
                <h3>What if I’m not a member?</h3>
                <p>
                    You can come and give it a try for two club days to see if it suits you before deciding
                    whether to join the club.
                </p>
                <h3>What if I’m just a beginner at Tennis?</h3>
                <p>
                    If you are a complete beginner club day can be challenging because you will be matched up
                    with players with a wide range of skills. However, this can be useful to see how your
                    skills match up. We want to encourage and welcome new members and will try and assist.
                    There is coaching at the club, and people often find that with some lessons and practice
                    they are quickly able to join in fully. If you have any questions, please just email our
                    club manager, Brad Watts: info@thorndonclub.co.nz.

                    Club days are friendly tennis matches coordinated by a volunteer club member on each club
                    day. All people that turn up to play will be matched with three other players to play
                    doubles matches. An afternoon tea is served on Saturdays and the bar is open on Wednesdays
                    from 5.30pm and Saturdays from 4.30pm.
                </p>
                <h3>What if Iâ€™m just a beginner at Tennis?</h3>
                <p>
                    If you are a complete beginner club day can be challenging because you will be matched up
                    with players with a wide range of skills. However, this can be useful to see how your
                    skills match up. We want to encourage and welcome new members and will try and assist.
                    There is coaching at the club, and people often find that with some lessons and practice
                    they are quickly able to join in fully. If you have any questions, please get in touch
                    with our <a href="#club-manager">club manager</a>.
